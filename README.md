# Supercavitation Swaps

** TECHNICAL DEMO ONLY DO NOT USE FOR SIGNIFICANT VALUE **

> Supercavitation is the process of injecting gas in front of a travelling submarine, creating a frictionless environment that enables significantly faster speeds.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqiRMy6mmms) for an overview.

See [this explainer](https://github.com/lncm/supercavitation-swaps/wiki/Frictionless-EVM-Submarine-Swaps) for more details on rationale and implementation.

This project was created for the BKK RSK Hackathon.

A Proof of Concept Supercavitation Swap Service, consisting of 3 main parts was implemented:

* [Server](https://github.com/lncm/supercavitation-server)
* [Contracts](https://github.com/lncm/supercavitation-contracts)
* [UI](https://github.com/lncm/supercavitation-ui)
